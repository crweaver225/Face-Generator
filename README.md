# Face-Generator
An Generative Adversarial Neural Network trained to draw human faces. The network is comprised of two competing neural networks, once that draws faces and the other that determines if the face being presented to it is a real face or drawn face. Both networks get better over time when in competition with each other producing better results. This project used python and tensorflow.
